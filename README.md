# Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) Dataset Generation and GAN Modeling

This repository provides code for generating optimal Receiver design parameters for Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) applications using analytical calculations and training a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to optimize these parameters. The cGAN model learns from the generated dataset to produce optimized configurations, enabling efficient wireless power transfer solutions.

## Directory Structure

- **models/wpt_dataset_checks.py**  
  This script generates WPT dataset parameters based on analytical calculations, ensuring that generated data aligns with desired physical constraints. This dataset serves as the foundation for training the cGAN model.

- **models/cGANModel_0920.py**  
  The main code for the conditional GAN (cGAN) model, designed to learn from the analytically generated WPT dataset. The model produces optimized WPT parameters, improving efficiency and performance in wireless power transfer applications.

- **Result/generated_wpt_parameters_20240920_1.csv**  
  This file contains the WPT parameters generated by the cGAN after training. These optimized parameters can be tested and analyzed to validate their effectiveness in real-world WPT scenarios.

## Usage

1. **Dataset Generation**:  
   Run `models/wpt_dataset_checks.py` to create the initial dataset based on analytical methods. This script calculates WPT parameters and ensures they meet necessary constraints.

2. **Training the cGAN Model**:  
   Execute `models/cGANModel_0920.py` to train the cGAN model using the generated dataset. The model will learn the parameter distributions and produce optimized WPT values.

3. **Generated Results**:  
   After training, the optimized WPT parameters are saved to `Result/generated_wpt_parameters_20240920_1.csv`. These can be analyzed and tested for potential performance improvements in WPT applications.
